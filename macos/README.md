# macOS User Preferences

Printing all the domains via defaults domains is a very helpful way to check what actually can be changed. Domains are objects that contain settings for a particular system component, installed application or a configuration `.plist` file located in `/Library/Preferences/`.

```sh
defaults domains | tr ',' '\n'
```
